Creates a PRA Jump Group and two Group Policies, then adding the Jump Group to the policies.
The Admin Group Policy has a deafult Jump Item Role of Administrator, the Standard User Group Policy has a default Jump Item Role of "Start Sessions Only"

A geographic prefix is added to approximate this data coming from an automation tool when a user makes a request, the script just asks the user for it.

The scripts will ask:
-Group name eg: firewalls, switches etc
-Prefix: it will append a hyphen

You can use this script to quickly create interrelated PRA objects
