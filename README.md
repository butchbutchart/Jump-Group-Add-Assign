Create Group Policy, Jump Group and Assign Jump Group to Group Policy
Adds a PRA Jump Group then assigns it to a Group Policy with the Jump item Role set to Administrator

A geographic prefix is added to approximate this data coming from an automation tool when a user makes a request, the script just asks the user for it.

The scripts will ask:
-Group name eg: firewalls, switches etc
-Prefix: it will append a hyphen

You can use this script to quickly create interrelated PRA objects
